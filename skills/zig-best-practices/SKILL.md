# Zig Best Practices

Helps you write, review, and improve idiomatic, safe, and performant Zig code. Adapt depth to the user's level — skip basics for advanced comptime questions, explain fundamentals for allocator newcomers.

## How to use this skill

Read **SKILL.md** for quick guidance, then consult 1-2 relevant reference files as needed.
**Do NOT load all references at once.**

## Mandatory workflows

### When writing code: completeness checklist

Before finalizing any code response, verify it includes **all** of the following that apply:

1. **Error set definition** — define specific error sets, never use `anyerror` in public APIs.
2. **Build boilerplate** — if a project is requested, include both `build.zig` AND `build.zig.zon`.
3. **init/deinit pair** — every struct that owns resources must have both.
4. **Trait implementations** — if a type will be used as a HashMap key, implement `eql()` and `hash()`. If it should be printable, implement `format()`.
5. **Doc comments** — all `pub` functions and types must have `///` doc comments.
6. **Inline tests** — include at minimum one test per public function using `std.testing.allocator`.

### When reviewing code: structured analysis

Review code in three mandatory passes. Do NOT skip any pass.

**Pass 1 — Memory Safety:**
- Every `alloc` has a matching `free` via `defer`
- Every fallible path after allocation has `errdefer`
- No global mutable allocators — allocators passed as parameters
- No dangling pointers from slices into freed memory
- No reading from `undefined` memory without initialization first

**Pass 2 — Concurrency, Hardware, and Low-Level Safety:**
- Hardware register pointers use `volatile` (not regular pointers)
- Thread-shared state uses `std.atomic.Value` or `std.Thread.Mutex` (NOT volatile)
- `@ptrCast` is always paired with `@alignCast` — or use `std.mem.readInt` for unaligned access
- Structs for hardware/binary protocols use `extern struct` or `packed struct` for guaranteed layout
- Integer overflow operators (`+%`, `|+`) are used intentionally
- `undefined` buffers are not read before being written

**Pass 3 — API Design and Completeness:**
- `anyerror` replaced with specific error sets
- `var` replaced with `const` wherever mutation isn't needed
- File/network I/O uses buffered readers/writers
- Public API has doc comments
- Null/optional handling is safe (no unguarded `.?` unwrap)

### When writing comptime/pointer-heavy code: verification step

Before outputting complex comptime or low-level pointer code, mentally trace through:

1. Does every comptime block actually run at comptime? (No runtime variables in comptime context)
2. Are `@setEvalBranchQuota` calls needed for large iterations?
3. Do all pointer casts maintain alignment? (`@ptrCast` + `@alignCast` together)
4. Are packed struct fields accessed correctly? (Cannot take address of non-byte-aligned fields)

### Compile-check step for comptime type-safety

When writing generic comptime code (event emitters, serializers, type-safe builders):

1. **Draft the type signature first** — write `fn MyType(comptime Param: type, comptime mapFn: fn (Param) type) type` before the body.
2. **Verify callback/function pointer signatures** — ensure `*const fn (*const PayloadType) void` matches what callers pass. Never use `anytype` for stored callbacks.
3. **Check that `@ptrCast`/`@alignCast` round-trips are correct** — type-erased pointers (`*const anyopaque`) must be cast back to the original type with matching alignment.
4. **Simulate a call mentally** — pick a concrete enum variant, trace the comptime function resolution, verify the callback type matches.

### Constraint checklist against `anytype` misuse

Before using `anytype` in a function signature, verify:

- [ ] The function genuinely works with multiple unrelated types (not just one)
- [ ] You cannot express the constraint with a concrete type or comptime parameter
- [ ] Stored function pointers use concrete types, not `anytype` (you cannot store `anytype`)
- [ ] The doc comment documents what interface the `anytype` parameter must satisfy

### When responding to multi-requirement prompts: requirement verification

When the prompt lists multiple requirements (numbered or bulleted), verify completeness before finalizing:

1. **Label each requirement** — mentally map each prompt requirement to a specific section of your code.
2. **Check for missing requirements** — scan the prompt again after writing code. Each requirement must have corresponding code.
3. **Verify test coverage** — each requirement should have at least one test exercising it.
4. **For complete module requests** — output a single, self-contained module (not scattered fragments). Include all imports, the type definition, all methods, and all tests in one code block.

### Failure recovery: compilation-proof output

When generating complex comptime or generic code:

1. **Start with the type signature** — write `fn MyType(comptime P: type, comptime F: fn (P) type) type` before the body. Verify the signature compiles in isolation.
2. **Use only `std.ArrayList`** for dynamic listener/callback storage — never `std.EnumArray` or `std.BoundedArray` for callback lists.
3. **Avoid `anytype` in stored function pointers** — you cannot store `anytype`. Use concrete `*const fn` types or `*const fn (*const anyopaque) void` for type erasure.
4. **Test your `@ptrCast` round-trips** — if you erase `*const fn (*const T) void` to `*const fn (*const anyopaque) void`, the reverse cast at call site must restore the original type.
5. **Include `const std = @import("std");`** at the top of every self-contained example.

## Quick principles

1. **Default to `const`.** Only use `var` when you genuinely need mutation.
2. **Pair every allocation with deallocation via `defer`.** Use `errdefer` for cleanup that should only run on error paths.
3. **Pass allocators as explicit parameters.** Functions that allocate accept an `Allocator` — no globals, no hidden heap.
4. **Errors are values.** Use specific error sets, propagate with `try`, handle with `catch`. Never silently discard errors without good reason.
5. **Use optionals (`?T`) for absence, not `undefined`.** Reserve `undefined` for buffers you'll fill immediately.
6. **Prefer slices (`[]T`) over many-item pointers (`[*]T`).** Convert raw pointers to slices as early as possible.
7. **Push work to `comptime` when it makes sense.** But don't overuse `anytype` — if a concrete type works, use it.
8. **Write inline tests with `std.testing.allocator`.** It catches memory leaks automatically.
9. **Run `zig fmt` unconditionally.** No exceptions, no debates.
10. **Profile before optimizing.** Choose the right build mode first — it's the single biggest performance lever.
